Experiment Description	Genome-wide methylation profiles were generated as part of a multi-omics characterization (SNP array, WES, RNA-seq, cDNA microarray) of a panel of gliomasphere cell lines and matched parental tumors.  See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27571888 about the GlioTeX panel.   Methylation profiling data in this record come from tumour samples.  SNP array (ArrayExpress E-MTAB-4804), cDNA microarray (ArrayExpress E-MTAB-4803), WES and RNAseq (European Genome-Phenome Archive EGAS00001001871) have been published before. In addition, for the current project we compare 450K methylation data to nanopore sequencing based methylation profiles. These sequencing data will be accessible via European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGAS00001002213).

Protocol Description	According to the manufacturer’s instructions.	500ng tumor DNA were subjected to bisulfite conversion and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	Glioblastoma tumor samples were collected during surgical resection. Informed consent has been obtained for all patients.	DNA was extracted from fresh tumor tissue that was snap-frozen immediately after surgery using QIAamp DNA Mini spin columns.
